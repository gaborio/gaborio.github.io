# About Me

I'm a political scientist and data specialist with extensive experience in survey research, statistical analysis, and software development. Currently serving as a Short Term Consultant for the World Bank Kenya Analytical Program on Forced Displacement (KAP-FD) and as an instructor at Universidad Javeriana.

My expertise lies in developing innovative research tools and software solutions that streamline data analysis and research processes. I've created multiple R packages and interactive applications that have enhanced research capabilities in social science contexts.
