# About Me
As a Senior Behavioral Scientist for Wellness and Resiliency at TaskUs, I specialize in the quantitative measurement of human well-being within the BPO industry, in particular among Trust & Safety operations. I hold an MA in Political Science from Vanderbilt University and have spent over a decade and a half refining my expertise in survey research, econometrics, and statistical programming.

Recently, my work has focused heavily on psychometrics, designing and validating instruments that accurately measure wellness, resiliency and the required skills for BPO work. I combine this theoretical knowledge with practical software development, creating R packages and interactive applications that make sophisticated analysis accessible. I am passionate about using data not just to observe trends, but to build systems that actively support mental health and safety.
